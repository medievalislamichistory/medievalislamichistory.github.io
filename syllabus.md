# Schedule

* **Introductions.** We will work chronologically through the history of the Middle East and Islamic world, broken into three unequal sections:
	* *Week One* [19-21 Aug]: Introductions.
* **Building an Empire.** From the death of the Prophet Muḥammad in 632 to the so-called “Decade of Anarchy” in 861, the first section of this class deals with the main empires in the Near East at the rise of Islam. Muslims introduced their own ideas into how to rule an empire, but they also built on the legacy of the Byzantines and Sasanians.
	* *Week Two* [24-28 Aug]: the Near East on the Eve of Islam 
	* *Week Three* [31 Aug-4 Sept]: Muḥammad and Conquests
	* *Week Four* [7-11 Sept]: early Umayyads 
	* *Week Five* [14-18 Sept]: late Umayyads
	* *Week Six* [21-25 Sept]: early ʿAbbasids
	* *Week Seven* [28 Sep-2 Oct]: Decade of Anarchy
* **Regional Emirates.** As central power collapsed, local elites called the shots even if they still have looked towards the center for approval and acknowledgement. Having multiple courts allows the development of regionally-specific expressions of power. There’s no “end” date to these regional powers, but we will continue up until the ʿAbbasids lose control over their own capital of Baghdad in 945.
	* *Week Eight* [5-9 October]: Iran & Central Asia
	* *Week Nine* [12-16 October]: Syria, Egypt, & Arabic
	* *Week Ten* [19-23 October]: North Africa
	* *Week Eleven* [26-30 October]: Spain & Italy
* **Conflicting Caliphates.** While regional emirates continue as the main drive in political organization, the emirs did not claim to speak on behalf of the whole Muslim community. The ʿAbbasids remained the caliphs, officially in charge of the Islamic world. Starting in 909, though, other groups tried to oust the ʿAbbasids and/or challenged their claim to the Caliphate.
	* *Week Twelve* [2-6 Nov]: Umayyads of Spain
	* *Week Thirteen* [9-13 Nov]: Fatimids
	* *Week Fourteen* [16-20 Nov]: Buyids/ʿAbbasids  

# Grades & Assignments

The instructor will post 2-3 recorded lectures to watch asynchronously in place of meeting on Mondays.

## Written Work

### Step One: Read a book. 

You can choose from the list below or write to the instructor to approve a different book.

* Donner, Fred. *Muhammad and the Believers.* This book argues that Islam started as a monotheist “believers’” movement, so the dividing lines between Judaism, Christianity, and Islam appear blurrier and later than we usually think. 
* El-Cheikh, Nadia. *Women, Islam, and Abbasid Identity.* This book argues that ʿAbbasid-era authors defined the ʿAbbasid umma (community) based on what it was not: Byzantine, Shiʿi, or jāhilī (pre-Islamic) and that these juxtapositions appear to have been gendered. 
* Khalek, Nancy. *Damascus after the Muslim Conquest.* This book examines the city of Damascus for what it can tell us about the transition from Byzantine to Umayyad rule, dealing with Christian and Muslim views of the city’s importance. 
* Pruitt, Jennifer. *Building the Caliphate.* This book analyzes the architecture of the Fatimids in North Africa (Tunisia and Egypt), but it places these developments onto a world stage by examining their development in context and through Christian, Shiʿi, and Sunni sources.
* Savage-Smith, Emilie and Yossef Rapoport. *Lost Maps of the Caliphs.* This book offers a study of a map of the world created in the 11th-century Fatimid court, arguing that the author drew on Byzantine Christian sources. It can give us a sense of how people understood and organized the world around them.
* Savant, Sarah. *New Muslims of Post-Conquest Iran.* This book examines the ways that the Muslims of early Islamic Iran discussed their own past, making Persian history make sense in a broader Islamic context.
* Spellberg, Denise. *Politics, Gender, and the Islamic Past.* This book argues that the many descriptions of the life and legacy of ʿAʾisha bt. Abī Bakr are driven by sectarian concerns, as her story was told and retold in Shiʿi and Sunni communities.  
* Urban, Elizabeth. *Conquered Populations in Early Islam.* This book focuses on slaves in the early Islamic world, examining what the stories of non-Arabs, slaves, and the children of slave mothers can add to the discussions of the early Muslim community.  
* Zadeh, Travis. *Mapping Frontiers*. This one is a bit different. It is about an ʿAbbasid caliph who had a nightmare that Gog and Magog were going to destroy the world, so he sent an envoy to make sure that they were imprisoned. It is about the extent of imperial power and the ways in which Christian and Muslim stories blurred together. 

As you read, try to keep in mind some of the themes we talk about in class, such as the relationship between power 
and religion; sectarianism or perceived divides within a religious community; community; Muslim-Christian relations; the definition of the Islamic world; and gender. 

### Step Two: Summarize the Book. [15% final grade]

Write a 5-page paper to explain what this book accomplishes. What is it about? What is the argument? This paper is due on 25 September, when you will explain your book in your small groups. This way, everyone can learn about more than one book. As part of this conversation, you should all discuss ways that these books add to or complicate the themes we’re studying in class.

### Step Three: Review your Groupmates’ Summaries. [5% final grade]

Read and comment on two of your groupmates’ summary papers. Fill out the worksheet posted under the paper module on Canvas. Your grade is determined by how you respond to your groupmates’ summaries. 

### Step Four: Find more Sources. [10% final grade]

Find 5 sources (objects or texts) relate to the theme you’re interested in. These can come from our course website—including sources we’ve talked about so far—or you can consult other websites or books. For each source, write the date, provenance, author/artist (if known), and a brief explanation of what you learn about your theme from each source. These are due on 16 October, when you will have time to talk through your material with your groupmates.

###  Step Five: Write a Draft. [10% final grade]

Write a 7-page paper about your theme. This paper should explain what you learned about your theme from this class, drawing on lectures, class discussions, and the book you read. Feel free to make this your own—including using the first person, if you like. Explain what *you* understand about this theme. You must use primary sources (from your list of 5 sources) and secondary sources (including the book you read & assigned readings; you do not need to do additional research). The draft is due on 13 November, when you will have time to talk through your drafts with your groupmates. 

### Step Six: Review your Groupmates’ Drafts. [5% final grade]

Read and comment on two of your groupmates’ drafts. Fill out the worksheet posted under the paper module on Canvas. Your grade is determined by how you respond to your groupmates’ drafts. 

### Step Seven: Revise and Submit. [15% final grade]

Revise your paper based on the comments provided by your classmates. 23 November is purposefully open so that you can talk through your paper with your groupmates or instructor. The final paper must be submitted on 4 December.
