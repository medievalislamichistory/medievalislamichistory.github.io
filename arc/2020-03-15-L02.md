# Goals:

- Getting to know main data structures in R

# Software:

* *the same*, with some new libraries:
	* R <https://www.r-project.org/> 
	* R Studio <https://www.rstudio.com/>

# Class:

* Practice worksheet: [`02_worksheets_data-structures.Rmd.zip`](../../files/02_worksheets_data-structures.Rmd.zip)

**NB:** Original worksheets prepared by Lincoln Mullen, GMU (<https://dh-r.lincolnmullen.com/worksheets.html>)

## Topics: Data Structures & Types

- Data structures
	- Vectors
	- Matrices
	- Data frames
	- Lists
- Subsetting operations

### Additional notes:

- `str()` compactly dysplays information about an R object
- `typeof()` determines the internal type or storage mode of an R object
- `class()` tells you the data structure of an R object:
  - `list`
  - `data.frame`
  - `matrix`
  - vector
    - `numeric`
      - `typeof()` > `double` --- a double-precision vector (floats; default numberic vector type)
      - `typeof()` > `integer` --- a vector of integers
    - `character`
      - `typeof()` > `character` --- a vector of strings/characters
      
- **Checking class/type & Conversion**
  - create `test <- c(1,2,3,4,5)`
    - `is.___` tests whether a variable of a `___` *class*.
      - or *type*: check the `typeof()` our `test` vector; then try `test.ch <- as.character(test)` and check the type again; can you convert it back into its initial type?).
    - `is.___` converts into a `___` *class*.
    - (`___` is either: `vector`, `matrix`, `data.frame`, `list`)
  - Now try the following commands and check the type and class of the new objects:
    - `test.matrix <- as.matrix(test)`
    - `test.df <- as.data.frame(test)`
    - `test.list <- as.list(test)`
    - `test.vector <- as.vector(test.df$test)`
